    <p>A handful of successful companies jumpstarted the tech sector in the Philippines. Coins.ph went on to become the
        most influential tech company in the community and Kalibbr was the first Philippine startup to be supported by
        Y-Combinator.
        <a href="#story/2651561/slide-1"></a>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Between 2015 and 2017, the support system for founders grew with the launch of Endeavor Philippines and other
        organizations that formalized connectivity between entrepreneurs. These included the Manila Angels Network and
        QBO, the first private-public initiative in the Philippines to foster collaboration.

    </p>

<div>
    <p>As of 2024, the entrepreneurial ecosystem is robust with mentors, angel investors, and serial founders. Growth in
        tech has been underpinned by widespread internet usage from a growing population. Coins.ph was acquired in 2019
        by GoJek, marking one of the first exits in the Philippines. Growth stage capital flowed to the country, with
        companies like GrowSari, Great Deals, and Kumu securing Series B or C rounds.

    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>The founders of the most influential companies in the network have now gone on to start second or third
        companies, and their early investees are becoming investors themselves. These Multiplier Effects™ reinvest local
        knowledge and wealth, and are prized assets in the community.
        <a href="#story/2651561/slide-4"></a>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Without the most influential companies, the ecosystem is barren. If the top seven companies and their
        contributions had not happened, it would be equivalent to the ecosystem in 2018 — setting the growth back by six
        years.
